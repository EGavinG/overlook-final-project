# Background and Description:
Overlook Hotel Management Application is a project with the goal of developing a robust tool to streamline room bookings and facilitate the calculation of customer bills for both hotel guests. The project encompasses the utilization of object and array prototype methods for effective data manipulation, the creation of a user-friendly interface, making network requests to fetch data, implementing a testing suite through Test-Driven Development (TDD), and ensuring code reusability while adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

# Goals and Objectives:
Employ object and array prototype methods to manipulate data efficiently.
Develop a user-friendly and accessible interface for customers.
Utilize the Fetch API for making network requests to fetch and add data.
Establish a comprehensive testing suite using Mocha and Chai, following the principles of Test-Driven Development.
Craft code that is DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and reusable, while strictly adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.

# Requirements
- Collaborative workflow using Pull Requests (PRs) with accountabilibuddy.
- Use of Fetch API for data retrieval and addition.
- Testing with Mocha and Chai.
- Initial setup using the provided Webpack Starter Kit repo.
- Use of a local server with specified endpoints for data operations.
- Build with accessibility in mind, using ARIA/WAVE/LightHouse and tools to test accessibility.

# Technologies 
HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Mocha, Chai, Fetch API, Lighthouse
